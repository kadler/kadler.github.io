It's been quite a while since I've posted anything here, but I've made a few
changes.

<!-- more -->

Your eyes do not deceive - I'm going by Korinne now and using she/they pronouns.
So yeah, I'm trans! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è  I'll be updating my identity elsewhere to match
soon and I'm looking forward to being my authentic self in all aspects of my
life now. My transition has been part of why I haven't published more updates
here as I've been quite busy with this and life in general and didn't want to
talk about it publicly yet.

Unfortunately I still can't talk about much work stuff yet either. We just
kinda got to the point where all the small stuff was done and now it's just
*all* big challenges. But we've got some big updates in the works and hopefully
I can share more soon. I may do a wrapup of all the minor updates we've done in
the meantime.
